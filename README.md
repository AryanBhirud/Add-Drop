# DropFinder

DropFinder allows users to specify which courses they wish to drop and which courses they would like to add, and connects users who can exchange their courses in the limited 3-day period where students in a university can drop courses they do not wish to continue with or add courses which have vacancies.

## Setup

To set up DropFinder, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/AryanBhirud/Add-Drop`
2. Install all dependancies using `npm install`
3. Start the server using `npm run dev`


Now, the DropFinder application should be up and running. Access it at http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
